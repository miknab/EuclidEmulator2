# This is a parameter file for EuclidEmulator2
# ********************************************
# The structure of this file is quite flexible. The following conditions must however be met:
#     - the order of the parameters must be as indicated below,
#     - it is assumed that all values after A_s are redshift values,
#     - the values must be separated by a comma (,),
#     - there must not be any comment (#) lines apart from this first block of comments.
#
# Further:
#     - you may remove parts or all of this comment block, 
#     - the number of whitespaces after each comma is arbitrary (no whitespaces at all
#           is also allowed),
#	  - the whitespace characters may be blanks, tabs or a mix of the two
#     - you may use scientific notation for the numbers (but you don't have to),
#     - you may put an arbitrary number of redshift values. 
#
# Below you can find three different example formats that EuclidEmulator2 can understand.
